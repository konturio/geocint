notes: "{country_name_capitalized} population density for 400m H3 hexagons. Built from
[Kontur Population: Global Population Density for 400m H3 Hexagons](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset)
Vector H3 hexagons with population counts at 400m resolution.

Gobal version of population dataset:
[Kontur Population: Global Population Density for 400m H3 Hexagons](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset)"
methodology: "Other"
methodology_other: "
Kontur Population dataset was built based on [H3: Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://h3geo.org).


Calculating population is based on overlapping Global Human Settlement Layer ([GHSL](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu))
with Facebook High Resolution Settlement Layer
([HRSL](https://research.facebook.com/downloads/high-resolution-settlement-layer-hrsl))
population data where available.


Known artifacts of both datasets are constrained using OpenStreetMap data as a hint.
Quarries and big roads are marked unpopulated, as they are often falsely detected as populated in GHSL.
Lakes, rivers, glaciers, sands, forests, and other similar areas are also marked as unpopulated.


We use Microsoft Building Footprint data, Land Information New Zealand and
Copernicus Global Land Service: Land Cover 100m to improve the accuracy of population distribution.


Building presence, or otherwise built-up area, implies there’s someone on the ground,
which is often missed in HRSL data for Africa.


We use scale coefficient taking into account the nesting of levels of administrative
division in cases when the total population of the administrative area significantly
differs from the official United Nations population estimates and projections.


Overly hot pixels like \"half a million people in a quarter of square kilometer\"
are spread out to more realistic surroundings.
The population is shifted to neighboring cells to satisfy constraints.


Non-integer populations are fixed up by \"gluing people back together\" to keep realistic human beings."
