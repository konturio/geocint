-- This whole loop is a trick.
-- We could have pulled this row in a loop like "cur_rec = select * from .... order by ... limit 1" with an index lookup.
-- That would work for an app but not in batch process: in batch process we have no spot to reorganize/vacuum table between loop iterations, and deleted entries are still in table and rechecked internally. So this index-order-by keeps removing head of the table and looks for first not-deleted entry on each iteration, which is slow.
-- Instead we do it other way: take snapshot of table and loop on it, using "for rec in (select...)". That removes rechecking that removed head of the table is actually removed, but we still have another problem: it's a snapshot, so rows we deleted from the queue "in the future" are still getting returned.
-- Luckily you can quickly check if a row is not deleted outside of snapshot, by selecting it by ctid. It's going to be a TID scan that goes to the page on disk directly and rechecks that it's still visible to new transaction.
-- This construction hinges on the fact that ctid's aren't going to change from old snapshot to new recheck transaction. However, from time to time we need to shrink the table, to save on the rechecks in the future.
-- That's why this all is wrapped into PROCEDURE - procedures can exist outside of transactions and perform maintenance operations, unlike functions.
-- Best would be to VACUUM FULL the table, just to shift values into holes. But for some reason it's not allowed in procedures. (that's a thing to report as a bug in postgres)
-- CLUSTER, which is internally same as VACUUM FULL with a sort by index, is luckily allowed.
-- CLUSTER renumbers all physical identifiers, so the loop has to be restarted and CLUSTER has to be performed outside of it.
