The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. The entire series of Human Development Index (HDI) values and rankings are recalculated every year using the same the most recent (revised) data and functional forms. The HDI rankings and values in the 2014 Human Development Report cannot therefore be compared directly to indices published in previous Reports. Please see hdr.undp.org for more information. The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.",World,static,admin_national,snapshot_year,index,t,🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏿,equal
